# 🏎️ F1 Data Analysis on Databricks

This project explores Formula 1 race data using Apache Spark on Databricks Community Edition.  
I connected AWS S3 to ingest datasets and performed distributed data analysis to uncover:

- Top drivers by average placement
- Race performance trends over the years
- Constructors’ performance consistency
- Fastest laps and time gaps

**Tech Stack:**  
Databricks · Apache Spark · PySpark · AWS S3 · Pandas
